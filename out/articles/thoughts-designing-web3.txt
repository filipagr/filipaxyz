d:T425,Firstly, it is very easy to be deceived by extravagant ideas and beautiful presentations. This happens both in our role as designers when we are called to work on a new project, as well as potential users or investors of a certain product or project. It is not exclusive to Web3 but is particularly common now since we are still in a very embryonic phase where the line between what is possible and impossible is thin and regularly changing. Especially in our role as designers, we should pay attention to the projects we choose to be involved with and do preliminary research on them and the team behind them. Although this may not prevent unforeseen events, it will make us much more confident in the project and the team we work with. It must happen since our work as designers on a project with the wrong motivations could harm many people in the future. As Victor Papanek said in his book "Design for the Real World", "there are more harmful professions than design, but only a few." So we must be aware of our power and use it according to our own values.c:[["$","p",null,{"children":"In the last few years, there has been a lot of discussion about Web3, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies.

In 1989, a group of scientists led by Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, or what we now know as the Internet. With over a decade of development, its function was to allow the sharing of technical information — among scientists and institutions worldwide – and its connection through hyperlinks (links that allowed us to go from one page to another).In the years that followed, there was an opening to the public outside the academic world, although the shared content was still not very interactive, functioning mainly as a reading space.
