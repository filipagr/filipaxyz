## Problem

The NFT market has evolved significantly, with marketplaces offering increasingly sophisticated features to attract and retain users. However, one significant barrier to entry remains: the upfront cost of purchasing NFTs. Many potential collectors are deterred by having to pay the full amount immediately, especially for higher-value NFTs.

## Solution

We developed a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) widget that can be easily integrated into any NFT marketplace. This solution allows buyers to:

- Split their NFT purchases into manageable installments
- Choose flexible payment plans
- Maintain ownership rights while completing payments
- Track their payment progress seamlessly

## Process

The development process focused on creating a widget that would be:

1. **Easy to integrate** - Marketplace owners can implement the widget with minimal code changes
2. **User-friendly** - Clear payment terms and intuitive interface for buyers
3. **Secure** - Robust payment processing and ownership management
4. **Flexible** - Customizable payment plans and terms

- Clear display of payment plans and terms
- Real-time calculation of installment amounts
- Integrated wallet connection
- Payment tracking dashboard
