## Overview

Astralscan is a block explorer built for the [Astral Protocol](https://www.astral.global/), a spatial extension of the decentralized web. It allows users to explore, verify, and interact with location-based attestations recorded onchain. The goal is to make the *where* of web3 as verifiable and accessible as the *what* and *when*.

This project was born from a serendipitous collaboration during my time at [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/), a community of web3 builders. There I met John from the Astral team, became fascinated with their vision, and volunteered to help bring spatial attestations to life through a better user experience.

## Problem

Astral had already developed a prototype called Logbook, which allowed users to create spatial attestations directly on the app. However, it lacked the ability to:

- Visualize attestations across time, space, or chain
- Filter or browse attestations in a meaningful way

There was a clear need for a new interface designed to both visualize and organize spatial attestations and support future development through a unified component system.

## Goals

- Design a map-based and list-based explorer for attestations across different chains
- Build a reusable and scalable component library
- Enable users to explore, add, and verify entries with location, media, and metadata
- Improve visual hierarchy and usability
- Lay the groundwork for features like filters, tags, and sharing

## Solution

The new app, Astralscan, will allow people to:

- View all attestations on a global map
- Browse entries in a sortable and filterable list view
- Click on entries to see details, including:
  - Location, date/time
  - Media (e.g. image proofs)
  - Description or memo
  - Chain metadata
- Create new attestations with a smoother, more guided UX

## Current Status & Next Steps

This is an ongoing project. Iâ€™m currently:

- Expanding the entry detail view to show additional metadata
- Improving loading/empty states
- Finalizing and documenting the component library
