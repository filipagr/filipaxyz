This embryonic phase of the Internet is what we now know as Web1, and it was during this time that big companies were born, such as Google, in 1998, whose mission was to organize all available content and facilitate its access."

This happens both in our role as designers when we are called to work on a new project, as well as potential users or investors of a certain product or project. It is not exclusive to Web3 but is particularly common now since we are still in a very embryonic phase where the line between what is possible and impossible is thin and regularly changing. Especially in our role as designers, we should pay attention to the projects we choose to be involved with and do preliminary research on them and the team behind them. Although this may not prevent unforeseen events, it will make us much more confident in the project and the team we work with. It must happen since our work as designers on a project with the wrong motivations could harm many people in the future. As Victor Papanek said in his book "Design for the Real World", "there are more harmful professions than design, but only a few." So we must be aware of our power and use it according to our own values.'
